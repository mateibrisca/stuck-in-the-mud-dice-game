"Stuck in the Mud!" Dice Game
=============

The fun of this dice game is the unpredictablility. Some turns end immidiately and some seem to go on forever. Any dice, which show a 2 or 5, become "Stuck in the mud!" and do not score any points. 

**Dice needed: 5**

**Object of the game: To achieve the highest score**

**Directions for play:**
1. The first player rolls all five dice. Add up the total any dice that do not show a 2 or 5.
2. The player sets aside any 2s or 5s, and throws the remaining dice. Add any dice which do not show 2 and 5 in the score. Any dice showing 2 or 5 is now also stuck. 
3. Continue in this way until all the dice are "Stuck in the Mud." After all dice are stuck, play passes to the next player. 

Coding project

Develop, design, and code a version of Stuck in the Mud to run in JavaFX. This can be a two player game or solitaire game.
